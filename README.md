# CPPS - Competitive Programming Problem Solutions
by Alexander Clines

**NOTE: THIS REPO IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Purpose
To display the solutions for programming problems on popular programming competition sites in a more readable form.

### What do I mean by readable form?
So if you have ever looked at the submitted solutions for problems on populate sites like TopCoder and CodeForces you may have noticed that the solutions can be very difficult to read. Now this is understandable as these sites have a stage in their competitions where other users can challenge their solutions's correctness, therefore the harder the solution is to read, the less likely it will be challenged. Or so it is believed. However this makes it difficult for programmers later down the road who are practicing on these problems, get stuck/lost and need to just see a solution for the purpose of _learning_. Thats where this repo comes in.

**The purpose of this repository is to provide clean, readable solutions to these problems so that others may learn and become better programmers.** 

### Who will benefit from this?
I do not recommend these problems for somebody just starting out in programming or in the langauge that the solution is written in.
Rather, if you are _already familiar with the language used_ and are looking to fulfill any/all of the following goals:
- Learn advanced algorithms and data structures
- Prepare for future competitive programming competitions
- Prepare for technical interviews

then I truly hope this repository will help you.

## Repository Information
### Sites used:
[TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com "TopCoder")
### Organization
All solutions here are first sorted by which site their respective problem is from, then lastly by problem name, language and solution (This allows for their to be multiple solutions per language per problem).
### Folder Structure
As far as folder structure works, they will follow the organization stated above, with a folder structure in between site name and problem name that reflects the organization of the site their problems are from.

i.e. TopCoder -> SRM669 -> SubdividedSlimes -> Java -> Solution1 -> SubdividedSlimes.class


## Disclaimer
I do not claim ownership of the problems discussed here (they belong to their respective sites), nor will I allow solutions to problems in _on going competitions_.
